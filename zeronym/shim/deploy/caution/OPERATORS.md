# Running the zero-indexer-shim (operator guide)

Run the shim as an attested Nitro enclave in front of your own lightwalletd or
Zaino. It forwards every gRPC call to your indexer unchanged; the one exception is
that it classifies `SendTransaction` (does it touch Orchard?) and logs the verdict.
The two backends are equals: the shim routes purely on the request path
(`src/proxy.rs`), so it never cares which indexer answers. lightwalletd is what
Shielded Labs run themselves.

**Phase 1 is forward-only, so it adds no privacy yet.** It classifies and logs
but forwards everything. What it buys you is the integration, the TLS, and the
attestation, all in place. **Phase 2, diversion, works and is what you should
deploy**: pass `--hub-nym` and Orchard-touching transactions go to Shielded Labs'
hub over the **Nym mixnet** instead of to your indexer, which is where privacy
begins. For you that is a redeploy, not a new integration. See "Diversion" below
for what is proven and what is not.

## Why an attested enclave

So that once diversion lands, you (the operator) cannot see the migration traffic:
the shim runs in an AWS Nitro enclave you operate but cannot inspect. Trust comes
from two halves together, a reproducible build (source matches a published hash)
and a Nitro attestation (that hash is what runs); `caution verify` checks both.
Full rationale in `deploy/caution/README.md`.

## Prerequisites

- **A Caution account.** Creation is gated on an access code:
  `caution register --alpha-code <CODE>`, code from Shielded Labs or
  `info@caution.co`. Registration needs a FIDO2 authenticator that supports
  discoverable credentials: a platform passkey or YubiKey 5 works, a Ledger does
  not (it deliberately disables resident keys, and the failure looks like "FIDO2
  is broken"). `--qr` prints a URL any browser can open, including on the same
  machine with Touch ID.
- **The `caution` CLI**:
  `git clone https://codeberg.org/caution/platform && cd platform && make install-cli`
  (macOS needs `CAUTION_ACCEPT_HOST_BUILD_RISK=1`). The reproducible StageX build
  of the CLI is Linux/x86_64 only, and that binary is what performs attestation
  verification, so an auditor should verify from a Linux/x86_64 box.
- **A push key**: `caution ssh-keys add --from-agent` (after login) authorizes
  the git pushes.
- **For BYOC, a paid Caution subscription.** Without one, `git push` returns
  HTTP 402 after your AWS stack has already been provisioned and is billing.
- **Your indexer** (lightwalletd or Zaino) reachable at a literal `IPv4:port`
  over TLS. If it serves plaintext gRPC (the default), front it with a TLS
  terminator that proxies **h2c** to the backend; nginx, Caddy, Envoy, and
  Traefik all work as long as h2c goes upstream. On Traefik v3 use an
  `IngressRoute` with `scheme: h2c`; the `serversscheme` annotation is silently
  ignored and every call 500s.
- **A DNS name you control** for wallets.
- A checkout of `github.com/ShieldedLabs/zero` at the commit you are auditing.

## Where the enclave runs

- **Fully managed**: in Caution's AWS account. `caution apps create` and push;
  nothing to provision.
- **BYOC**, your own AWS account:
  `AWS_PROFILE=<profile> caution init --byoc --region <region>` provisions the
  VPC, S3 bucket, instance and builder roles, launch template and ASG, and wires
  the `caution` git remote. Teardown is `caution teardown --byoc`.

Pass `--region` explicitly, chosen by measured latency to your indexer; the
silent default is `us-west-2`. Never hand-allocate an Elastic IP for the app: it
is invisible to `teardown --byoc` and then blocks VPC deletion.

## Deploy

Create an empty **public** git repository first (the assembled context gets
published there; verification depends on it), then:

```bash
sh zeronym/shim/deploy/caution/assemble-caution.sh \
  --name        <enclave-name> \
  --backend     <indexer-ipv4>:<port> \
  --backend-tls <name-on-indexer-cert> \
  --tls-domain  <wallet-facing-domain> \
  --app-source  <public-git-url>
```

- `--backend` is a literal IPv4 (the enclave never resolves DNS).
- `--backend-tls` is the name on your indexer's cert: dialed by IP, authenticated by name.
- `--tls-domain` is what wallets connect to; the in-enclave Caddy gets its Let's Encrypt cert for it.
- `--app-source` is recorded in the manifest so `caution verify` can rebuild what
  you deployed. Without it verification is impossible for anyone, including you.

Re-running the script is safe: it preserves `.caution/` and the git history, so
the directory stays bound to its app. Then, from the directory it creates:

```bash
caution login --username <name> --qr
caution apps create      # fully managed; BYOC already has the remote from `caution init --byoc`
git push caution main    # builds and boots the enclave; prints its IP
```

Publish the same commit to your public repo, on `main`, and tag it:

```bash
git remote add origin <public-git-url>
git push origin main && git tag deploy-1 && git push origin deploy-1
```

The manifest pins the branch AND the commit, so push `main` itself, and tag each
deployed commit: a branch tip moves and can be garbage-collected, the tag keeps
the manifest's commit reachable. Caution's own remote is push-only, so this
published repo is the only route an auditor has to the deployed tree.

**DNS — ordering is load-bearing.** On fully-managed Caution the record is a
**CNAME to `<app-id>.apps.caution.sh`**, not an A record, and the app id does not
exist until `caution apps create` has run. So the sequence is:

```
caution apps create      # prints the app id
  -> create the CNAME:   <tls-domain>  CNAME  <app-id>.apps.caution.sh
git push caution main    # boots the enclave AND orders the certificate
```

Create the record **before** the push: the push is what orders the certificate,
and ACME can only validate a name that already resolves. Every push spends one of
that hostname's **5 weekly production issuances** (there is no staging on this
path), so a push into missing DNS burns one. `zeronym/deploy.sh` automates this
in the right order.

Expect the first ACME attempt to fail with `NXDOMAIN` and **recover on its own in
about a minute**: Caution publishes the A record on `…apps.caution.sh` only after
the health check passes, so the chain cannot resolve when Caddy first tries.
Measured on the attested hub: deploy completed 15:03:33Z, TLS still failing at
15:04, valid production Let's Encrypt certificate serving by 15:05. Only escalate
if it is still failing after ~5 minutes.

The record must be **DNS-only**: a Cloudflare-proxied (orange cloud) record
terminates TLS at Cloudflare, which destroys the in-enclave-key property the
whole attestation argument rests on, and blocks the ACME challenge so no
certificate ever issues. Both failures are silent.

**Choose the wallet-facing name carefully.** It must be a name your *indexer's*
operator holds no certificate for. A shim served on a hostname they can obtain a
certificate for can be transparently impersonated by them, which defeats the
guarantee for exactly the naive-TLS wallets it protects.

Then point wallets at `<tls-domain>:443`. One app per enclave.

## Verify

```bash
# transparency: the reply matches your backend's own
grpcurl -import-path lightwalletd/walletrpc -proto service.proto \
  <tls-domain>:443 cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc.CompactTxStreamer/GetLightdInfo

caution verify                         # from the assembled directory
sh zeronym/shim/deploy/reproduce.sh    # source reproduces deploy/EXPECTED_SHA256
```

No proto handy? A raw gRPC probe needs neither grpcurl nor a checkout:

```bash
printf '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' | curl -s --http2 \
  -H 'content-type: application/grpc' -H 'te: trailers' --data-binary @- \
  https://<tls-domain>/cash.z.wallet.sdk.rpc.CompactTxStreamer/GetLightdInfo | strings
```

**On fully-managed apps, pass the attestation URL explicitly.** `caution apps
create` does not write a `.caution/deployment.json` (that is `caution init`, the
BYOC path), so verify has nothing to infer from and fails with *"No deployment
found. Either run 'caution init' first or provide --url"*. That message is
misleading here — do **not** run `caution init`, which would provision a second
AWS stack. Just name the endpoint:

```bash
caution verify --attestation-url https://<tls-domain>/attestation
```

The same command is what anyone else uses, with no Caution account and no
checkout of yours.

Caveats:

- Without `app_sources` in the manifest (the `--app-source` flag), verify cannot
  reproduce the deployment, and the attestation then proves only that *some*
  image runs in a genuine enclave.
- Older copies of this guide warned that verify reports PCR0/1 FAILED on a
  healthy enclave, because Caution's builder fetched its framework from a
  floating `main.tar.gz`. **That is fixed**: on the attested pair deployed
  2026-08-14 the manifest pinned both the enclave and framework sources to
  commits, and **all three PCRs reproduced** on both, with the TLS certificate
  binding verified. Expect a clean `✓ Attestation verification PASSED`.
- **Do not fall back to "PCR2 is the one that matters".** That advice circulated
  while PCR0/1 were failing, and it is wrong on this platform. Measured
  2026-08-14 across the attested shim and hub — two entirely different binaries:

  | | shim | hub |
  |---|---|---|
  | PCR0 | `accb679a…` | `218d1f64…` |
  | PCR1 | `accb679a…` | `218d1f64…` |
  | PCR2 | `21b9efbc…` | `21b9efbc…` **(identical)** |

  **PCR2 does not distinguish the application.** PCR0/PCR1 are what change with
  it. So an attestation accepted on a PCR2 match alone would prove only that
  *some* Caution enclave is running, not that it is running your reviewed code —
  which is the entire claim. Require **all three** to reproduce, and treat a
  PCR0/1 mismatch as a real finding about the application until proven otherwise.
  (The observation is empirical; we have not confirmed with Caution which layer
  each index measures on their EIF layout.)

For `reproduce.sh`, the result that counts is a match on independent hardware:
two builds on one machine share CPU, kernel, and Docker. On an arm64 Mac it runs
under emulation; a third-party operator has matched the then-published hash on
native x86_64.

## Testnet

Fully supported, no changes: the classifier is a pure function of the transaction
bytes with no network parameters, so behavior is identical. Just point `--backend`
at a testnet indexer. A worked example, courtesy of zec.rocks:
`--backend 199.170.132.107:443 --backend-tls na-jfk.testnet.metal.zec.rocks`,
and `GetLightdInfo` through the shim answers `chainName: "test"`.

## Diversion (Phase 2) — two transports, one hub

Diversion works end to end over both transports. **Which one you use must match
the hub**: ask Shielded Labs which mode the hub you are pointing at runs, or read
`https://<hub-domain>/nym-status` — `mixnet_connected: true` means Nym mode,
`false` means clearnet. **As of 2026-08-17 the live hub (hub-6) is clearnet.**

**Clearnet mode** (current) — add to `assemble-caution.sh`:

```
  --hub     <hub-ip>:443 \
  --hub-tls <hub-domain>
```

The hub is dialled by IP and its certificate verified by name — the same pattern
as `--backend`/`--backend-tls` for your indexer, so no DNS inside the enclave.
Shielded Labs supply the IP (it is only known after the hub deploys, and it
changes on every hub redeploy because managed apps are immutable). No
`--nym-egress` rules; assemble emits a `/32` egress to the hub for you.

**Nym mode** (built, tested, and how it will run once the enclave network path
supports it):

```
  --hub-nym    <hub-nym-address> \
  --nym-egress 92.39.63.14/32:443:tcp \
  --nym-egress 172.104.178.252/32:443:tcp \
  --nym-egress 0.0.0.0/0:9000:tcp \
  --nym-egress 1.1.1.1/32:53:udp
```

Shielded Labs supply the hub address; it is also readable from the hub itself at
`https://<hub-domain>/nym-address`, which is the authoritative copy (see
"Operating" for why it can change). The `--nym-egress` rules DECLARE what the
enclave needs for the mixnet: two of the SDK's three built-in nym-api endpoints
(the third, Fastly, is deliberately excluded — shared CDN edges), a gateway, and
a DNS resolver.

They are not an allowlist, and this passage used to call them one (corrected
2026-08-19). Caution does not enforce `egress` rules: the whole list is reduced
to whether it is empty, and a non-empty list yields unrestricted outbound plus
DNS. Getting these rules right still matters, because the declaration is what the
enclave is *supposed* to need and is what a reader audits — but it constrains
nothing today, so do not treat a narrow list as containment. Forward-only stays the default: no
`--hub-nym` and no `--hub`, no diversion.

**What clearnet mode gives up.** Both modes keep batching, the operator's
indexer never seeing the migration, and attestation. Clearnet mode loses
shim↔hub *unlinkability*: the hub sees which shim sent each migration and when.
With one shim that link is trivially known regardless; it matters as the fleet
grows, which is exactly when Nym returns. Full table in the hub's operator
guide, "Clearnet mode".

`--nym-gateway <identity>` pins the entry gateway (and lets you narrow the
`0.0.0.0/0:9000` rule to a `/32`). It **works** — verified against four public
gateways on 2026-08-14 — but it takes the gateway's IDENTITY key while the
egress rule takes its IP ADDRESS, and a mismatch fails closed with no console on
an attested enclave.

What changes for you: an Orchard-touching `SendTransaction` never reaches your
indexer (proven in CI by a connection-counting backend, `tests/divert.rs`), and
the wallet gets the usual lightwalletd reply, `errorCode 0` with the txid in
`errorMessage`. Every `GetTransaction` is served by the hub too, since a shim
that held no state could not tell a migration's txid from any other. If the hub
is unreachable the shim answers gRPC `UNAVAILABLE` and still never falls back to
your indexer: it fails closed, by design.

Proven on mainnet 2026-08-11 over the clearnet hop: a real Orchard-to-Ironwood
migration from an unmodified wallet was held on submission and published on the
hub's 20-block cadence. Proven again over **Nym** on 2026-08-13: a migration went
wallet → shim → mixnet → hub → broadcast, and since the hub's clearnet submit
path is now closed, its arrival is proof the mixnet carried it rather than
inference. **Batch size was one in both**, so these runs prove the mechanics and
content privacy, not batching anonymity.

### What this does and does not hide

State this plainly to anyone relying on a shim you run. It is the claim the whole
system stands on, and overclaiming is worse than the limit itself:

> Given a verified attestation, the code holding your migration in plaintext is
> the published code: it broadcasts the transaction and retains nothing
> identifying. It does **not** hide from the hub's host that a migration was
> submitted at a given time, and at current volumes that timing is linkable to
> the resulting on-chain transaction. **The anonymity set is the batch, and the
> batch is currently size one.** For an Orchard **deshield**, the amount remains
> recoverable by the operator through address-level queries the shim does not
> intercept.

So: content privacy and IP unlinking are real today. **Batching anonymity is
not** — it only becomes true above an adoption threshold, because the anonymity
set is the cross-operator batch and is worth exactly as many operators as are
running diversion.

### What it costs to run

The shim holds a **persistent, shaped Nym client**. It emits cover traffic
continuously — **order of gigabytes per day, per shim** — whether or not anyone
diverts anything. That is not waste: uniform traffic is what hides *that* a
divert happened. The knobs that would reduce it
(`disable_loop_cover_traffic_stream`, `--no-cover`, `--fastmode`) are
**forbidden**, because each one forfeits the shaping.

Budget for it, and know that Nym's free tier meters **volume** (currently
250 GB / 30 days). See "Known failure modes" for what happens when it runs out.

## Config reference

Every option is a CLI flag and an environment variable (prefix `ZIS_`). On
Caution you set these through `assemble-caution.sh`; the table is for
understanding what they mean.

| env var | meaning | you point it at |
|---|---|---|
| `ZIS_LISTEN` | wallet-facing listen address | `0.0.0.0:8083` inside the enclave (the port Caution's Caddy forwards to) |
| `ZIS_BACKEND` | backing indexer address, a literal `SocketAddr` | **your own indexer** |
| `ZIS_BACKEND_TLS` | DNS name to authenticate the backend cert as | the name on your indexer's cert |
| `ZIS_TLS_DOMAIN` | wallet-facing ACME domain | left **unset** on Caution; the in-enclave Caddy owns the cert |
| `ZIS_HUB_NYM` | hub Nym address(es) to divert to — a comma-separated LIST | the address from `https://<hub-domain>/nym-address` |
| `ZIS_NYM_GATEWAY` | pin the entry gateway by IDENTITY key (repeatable; rotates across rebuilds) | **leave unset for now** — untested against public Nym |
| `ZIS_NYM_ROTATION_SECS` | rotate the shim's mixnet identity every N seconds, bounding how long the hub can link your submissions | a deployment decision; unset = never |
| `ZIS_CAUTION_ATTESTATION` | let the shim answer Caution's own `/attestation` and health paths | **`true` on managed Caution** (the default). Under h2c the platform routes these to the app, and a shim that proxied them to your indexer would fail its health check and never boot |
| `ZIS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_SECS` | how long a `GetTransaction` waits for the hub before failing closed | default **90 s** (raised from 25 s against measurement). Tuning it changes the enclave config, not the binary, so your `EXPECTED_SHA256` and reproducibility trail stay put. It **multiplies** by the number of `--hub-nym` addresses |
| `ZIS_HUB` / `ZIS_HUB_TLS` | **legacy** clearnet hop | unset — the current hub refuses clearnet submissions |

`ZIS_BACKEND_TLS` does double duty: the name the backend's certificate must
present, and the request `:authority` your ingress routes on. Hence the one
confusing symptom: a bare `grpcurl <ip>:443` with no name fails with
"certificate signed by unknown authority", because the terminator serves its
default certificate to a client that sent no SNI. That is expected, not a
backend fault; the shim always sends the name.

When diversion is configured (`--hub-nym`), the diverted path is baked into the
audited binary and the enclave's egress rules at assemble time, not a knob you
set at runtime: an operator cannot silently repoint it.

## Operating

- **The enclave IP is stable across successful redeploys.** Caution allocates an
  Elastic IP per app and re-associates it each deploy; it survives instance
  replacement. It is released only by teardown or by a failed deploy's rollback,
  so a changed IP means the previous deploy failed and rolled back.
- **Redeploy** = re-assemble, `git push caution main`: the preserved history
  makes the push a fast-forward. If it is refused (unrelated history, or the app
  in a failed state), fall back to the cycle: `echo y | caution apps destroy
  <app-id>`, `git remote remove caution`, `caution apps create`, push, repoint
  DNS (new app id AND new IP).
- **Certificates**: the enclave is diskless, so every restart is a fresh Let's
  Encrypt order, and every push spends one of the hostname's 5 weekly production
  issuances (there is no staging on this path). Iterate on throwaway
  `--tls-domain`s; strategy in `RESTARTS.md`.
- **Watch Certificate Transparency** (crt.sh) for your `--tls-domain`: as the
  domain's operator you are best placed to notice a certificate you cannot
  account for.
- **Session expiry**: FIDO2 sessions expire often, and the resulting errors point
  the wrong way. "No deployment found. Either run 'caution init' first" has two
  causes — an expired session, and a fully-managed app (which never writes
  `.caution/deployment.json`). Re-run `caution login --qr --username <name>`, and
  for verify pass `--attestation-url`. **Never** run the suggested `caution init`:
  it would provision a second AWS stack.
- **Reading state from an attested enclave**: there is no SSH. Use
  `https://<tls-domain>/attestation` and, on the hub, `/healthz` and
  `/nym-address`. Deliberately, no endpoint exposes queue depth or counts —
  that would be an oracle for the anonymity-set size.
- Boots but will not serve? Set `debug.enabled = true`, push, and read
  `/var/log/nitro_enclaves/*.log` over SSH. Debug **disables attestation**, so it
  is a diagnostic only, never the deployed config — and note the SSH key is
  whatever you passed to `--ssh-key` at assemble time, so the person who deploys
  is the one who can read the console.

## Known failure modes

All three of these fail **quietly**. None throws an error you would see without
looking, which is what makes them worth reading before you deploy.

**1. The hub's Nym address changes, and your shim is baked to the old one.**
The hub's identity lives in RAM (an enclave is diskless), so a hub **process
restart** mints a new address. Your shim carries the old one in its immutable
enclave config, so every divert then fails closed until you re-assemble and
redeploy against the new address. A client *reconnect* is fine — the address
survives that — but a restart is not.

- **Detect:** poll `https://<hub-domain>/nym-address` and alert on any change.
- **Recover:** re-assemble with the new `--hub-nym`, redeploy, repoint DNS if the
  app id changed.

**2. A hub restart drops migrations your wallets were already told succeeded.**
The shim answers `SendTransaction` as soon as the migration is **dispatched onto
the mixnet** — it does not wait for the hub's acknowledgement, because that is a
full mixnet round trip (10s at best, minutes under load) and would stall wallets.
The hub then holds submissions in a RAM-only queue until its next flush. If it
restarts in that window, those migrations are gone and **no error ever reached
the wallet**.

This is deliberate, not a bug: persisting the queue would mean writing plaintext
migrations to disk, which is the one thing the hub exists to prevent. A
`SendTransaction` success has never promised block inclusion anyway — an ordinary
send only reaches a mempool. But say it plainly to your users: **the wallet must
resend if the transaction never confirms.** Resends are safe; the hub deduplicates
on the payload hash.

**3. Mixnet bandwidth runs out, and diversion stops.** Nym's free tier meters
volume, and a shim's continuous cover traffic consumes gigabytes per day. When the
allowance is exhausted the mixnet client stops working and every divert fails
closed. There is **no ticketbook (paid credential) mechanism wired up yet**, so
today the recovery is manual.

- **Detect: poll `GET /nym-status`.** Nothing else works, and it is worth
  understanding why. The shim's reachability proves nothing (the clearnet proxy
  answers normally while the mixnet hop is dead); the wallet's reply proves
  nothing (the shim answers success as soon as a migration reaches its internal
  transport); and an end-to-end divert test proves nothing either, because the
  `GetTransaction` that would confirm arrival is itself a mixnet round trip.

  ```
  curl https://<tls-domain>/nym-status
  {"diversion_configured":true,"mixnet_connected":true,"client_deaths":0,"consecutive_rebuild_failures":0}
  ```

  | field | alert when |
  |---|---|
  | `diversion_configured` | `false` on a shim you built with `--hub-nym` — it is forward-only and hiding nothing |
  | `mixnet_connected` | `false` — **migrations are being silently dropped right now** |
  | `client_deaths` | climbing steadily: gateway churn |
  | `consecutive_rebuild_failures` | non-zero and growing: it is down and not recovering |

  `GET /healthz` is process liveness. Neither endpoint exposes send counts,
  timestamps, or txids — a "last diverted at" field would tell any passer-by
  exactly when a migration went out, which is the timing correlation this system
  exists to prevent.

**Related: `GetTransaction` for a just-diverted migration is slow, and may not
answer at all.** The mixnet is slow — a migration can take minutes to reach the
hub, which is fine, because a migration is time-insensitive by design. The lookup
path, though, *waits* for a full hub round trip: measured 2026-08-14 it did not
complete once in 14 attempts across two independently deployed pairs, against
what was then a 25-second budget. The budget is now **90 s**
(`ZIS_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT_SECS`), sized so the ~12.6 s of pure packet emission at the
throttled send rate has real headroom for queueing. If it still times out the
wallet is told `UNAVAILABLE` — failing closed, never falling back to your indexer
— and sees its transaction once it is mined and ordinary sync picks it up.

Worth knowing for diagnosis: **the timing tells you which failure you have.** A
lookup that fails after the full ~25 s means the shim sent and got no reply (the
mixnet). A lookup that fails *instantly* means the shim had no transport to send
on at all (a configuration or client-lifecycle problem). A healthy pass-through
call like `GetLightdInfo` answers in about 2 s and is your control.

## Forward-only caveat

Say it plainly to anyone relying on a shim deployed without `--hub`: it forwards
**every** request, including Orchard-touching `SendTransaction`s, to your
indexer. Nothing is diverted or hidden. Privacy begins when diversion is on.
