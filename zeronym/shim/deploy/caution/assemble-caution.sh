# Assemble the Caution deploy repository for zero-indexer-shim.
#
# A Caution app is a git repository you push to; whatever is at its root is what
# gets built into an EIF. So this produces exactly that: the reproducible build
# context, plus caution.hcl and a Containerfile at the root where Caution looks
# for them.
#
# Everything comes from `git archive HEAD` by way of deploy/assemble.sh. Nothing
# is read from the working tree, which is what makes "the enclave runs the code
# at commit X" a checkable statement rather than a hope.
#
# POSIX sh with no pipelines, for the reason recorded in assemble.sh: /bin/sh is
# dash on Debian and Ubuntu, dash has no `-o pipefail`, and a pipeline without
# it hides the exit status of everything but the last command.
#
# Usage:
#   sh .../assemble-caution.sh --name <enclave> --backend <ip:port> [dest-dir]
#
# One enclave fronts exactly one indexer, so each backend gets its own app and
# its own assembled repo. Both arguments are required rather than defaulted: a
# wrong backend produces an enclave that boots, serves, and quietly proxies for
# something nobody intended, which is worse than one that fails to start.
