# Assemble the Caution deploy repository for zero-indexer-shim.
#
# A Caution app is a git repository you push to; whatever is at its root is what
# gets built into an EIF. So this produces exactly that: the reproducible build
# context, plus caution.hcl and a Containerfile at the root where Caution looks
# for them.
#
# Everything comes from `git archive HEAD` by way of deploy/assemble.sh. Nothing
# is read from the working tree, which is what makes "the enclave runs the code
# at commit X" a checkable statement rather than a hope.
#
# POSIX sh with no pipelines, for the reason recorded in assemble.sh: /bin/sh is
# dash on Debian and Ubuntu, dash has no `-o pipefail`, and a pipeline without
# it hides the exit status of everything but the last command.
#
# Usage:
#   sh .../assemble-caution.sh --name <enclave> --backend <ip:port> \
#       --backend-tls <cert-name> --tls-domain <wallet-facing-domain> \
#       [--app-source <public-git-url>] \
#       ( --hub <ip:port> --hub-tls <hub-cert-name>              # clearnet hop
#       | --hub-nym <addr1,addr2> --nym-egress <cidr:port[:proto]> ... # mixnet
#           [--nym-rotation-secs <n>] )                          \
#       [dest-dir]
#
# --hub (clearnet) or --hub-nym (mixnet) turns diversion ON; they are mutually
# exclusive. Without either, the shim is forward-only: it classifies and logs,
# and still hands every migration to the operator's indexer.
#
# --hub-nym diverts over the Nym mixnet. It needs one or more --nym-egress
# allowlist rules (the gateway(s) and nym-api set, from the host operator), and
# the enclave reaches those, NOT the hub directly. See the long note in the Nym
# transport block for the DNS / breadth / ticketbook decisions this requires.
# The nym-api endpoint is NOT configurable here, so those rules have to agree
# with what nym-sdk's own built-in endpoint list resolves to on the day; the
# checks in that block say what breaks when they stop agreeing.
#
# --app-source records, in the manifest's build block, the public git URL where
# this assembled repository is published. `caution verify` clones that URL and
# rebuilds; without it verify refuses outright and the attestation proves only
# that SOME image runs in a real enclave.
#
# One enclave fronts exactly one indexer, so each backend gets its own app and
# its own assembled repo. Both arguments are required rather than defaulted: a
# wrong backend produces an enclave that boots, serves, and quietly proxies for
# something nobody intended, which is worse than one that fails to start.

	#   1. DNS. The default Nym network reaches its nym-apis and gateways by NAME,

	#      `--nym-egress <resolver>/32:53:udp` rule and accept DNS, or pin every
	#      endpoint by IP and keep the no-DNS posture. The no-DNS path ALSO needs
	#      shim-side support the driver does not yet expose (IP-literal --nym-apis,
	#      no_hostname, a custom topology), so today the deployable configuration is
	#      DNS-permitted. Tracked in NYM_PLAN.md M6.
	#   2. Breadth. One /32 per gateway and per nym-api is tightest but must be
	#      updated as the set churns; a broader mixnet CIDR is looser but stable.
	#   3. Ticketbooks. A public-network run needs bandwidth credentials, and if
	#      they are acquired on-chain in-enclave, a Nyx RPC egress rule as well.
	#
