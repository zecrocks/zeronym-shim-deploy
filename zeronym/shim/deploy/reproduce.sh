# The Auditor Role, in one script: build zero-indexer-shim twice from cold,
# check that the two binaries are byte-identical, AND check that they equal the
# hash this repo publishes in deploy/EXPECTED_SHA256.
#
# Both halves matter, and the second is the one that is easy to leave out. Two
# builds that agree with each other but not with the published hash is exactly
# the cross-machine divergence this script exists to catch, and without the
# EXPECTED comparison that case exits 0.
#
# Same pattern as .github/workflows/caution-z3-reproduce.yml, which proves the
# same property for zebrad and zainod. --no-cache on both builds, and the
# Containerfile deliberately uses no BuildKit cache mounts, because --no-cache
# does NOT clear cache mounts and a warm target/ directory would make this test
# a lie.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. Two builds on ONE machine control for
# time, PID, tmpdir and build ordering. They do NOT control for CPU feature
# detection, kernel, or Docker and BuildKit versions. The gold standard is a
# second build on independent hardware whose hash matches the published one,
# which is what the EXPECTED check turns from an eyeballed log line into a
# pass/fail. .github/workflows/zeronym-shim-reproduce.yml runs this script on a
# native x86_64 runner for precisely that reason.
#
# Budget: under three minutes per cold build under Rosetta on an arm64 Mac, so
# about six minutes total.
#
# Env overrides: CTX (assembled context dir), OUT (artifact dir),
# EXPECTED (override the published hash; empty string skips the comparison,
# which is only correct when deliberately re-baselining).
