//! The divert and lookup paths over the MIXNET transport, end to end.
//!
//! The same properties `divert.rs` asserts for the clearnet hop, asserted for
//! the Nym transport across the whole intercept path: a wallet's gRPC call
//! enters the real shim, is classified, framed, correlated, answered, and
//! returned, with the operator's connection-counting indexer held at zero
//! throughout.
//!
//! The hub here is a task holding the DRIVER ends of the transport's channels:
//! it reads the frames that would go onto the mixnet, decodes them with the
//! same wire codec the real hub uses, and writes back the frames a hub would
//! send. No SDK and no fake client, exactly as the transport's own tests and
//! the hub listener's tests are driven; what the mixnet itself does to those
//! bytes is proven separately by the nymnet harness.
//!
//! Two things differ from the HTTP path and are asserted here rather than
//! assumed: the wallet's txid is computed LOCALLY from the diverted bytes
//! (the ack deliberately carries none, D5), and a silent hub fails closed on
//! the transport's own timeout instead of a refused TCP connection.
