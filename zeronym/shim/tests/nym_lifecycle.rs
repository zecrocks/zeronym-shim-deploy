//! The mixnet client's lifecycle, driven through the supervisor's channels.
//!
//! The supervisor is what makes the D11 rotation policy a parameter rather than
//! a redeploy, and what keeps the SDK's own hard stop (D12) from ending the
//! shim's ability to divert. It touches no SDK: these tests hold the driver
//! ends and assert the commands it emits, exactly as the transport's tests hold
//! the mixnet ends.
//!
//! Time is PAUSED throughout (`tokio::time::pause`), so a rotation period of
//! an hour is exercised in microseconds and the assertions are about ordering
//! and cause, never about how long a test slept.
