//! The shim's outbound path over the Nym mixnet: send a `SubmitV1` and await
//! its `AckV1`; send a `LookupV1` and await its `LookupReplyV1`.
//!
//! The design keeps the Nym SDK out of everything here, mirroring the hub's
//! listener. A driver task (which lands with the SDK) owns the mixnet client
//! and does nothing but move bytes: it takes each [`OutFrame`] this module
//! produces and puts it on the mixnet, and hands every inbound mixnet message
//! back as raw bytes. So the transport is a plain async function over three
//! channels — requests in, frames out, mixnet messages in — and its whole
//! behaviour is exercised by holding the driver ends and feeding bytes, with no
//! SDK and no fake client.
//!
//! Correlation is the one job here (D5): every request carries a random nonce,
//! the hub echoes it in the reply, and [`run_transport`] owns the
//! nonce-to-waiter map as its private state — single owner, no lock. A reply
//! for an unknown nonce is dropped (a duplicate, or one that raced its caller's
//! timeout); a reply of the WRONG KIND for a known nonce is ignored and its
//! waiter left pending, so a confused or hostile hub cannot answer a lookup
//! with an ack; an empty inbound message is an SDK SURB-replenishment artifact
//! and is filtered before it reaches the codec (D12), exactly as the hub's
//! listener filters them.
//!
//! The per-request timeout lives at the call site in [`NymHandle`], around the
//! waiter: a dead mixnet, a lost reply, or a gone driver all end in a typed
//! error the intercept path maps onto its existing fail-closed arms
//! (UNAVAILABLE to the wallet, never the operator's indexer). A submit's
//! wallet-level retry resends identical bytes and the hub's queue dedups, so no
//! retry state is kept here.
//!
//! How many reply SURBs to attach is carried on each [`OutFrame`] as data, not
//! decided by the driver: the count is a fixed function of the frame type
//! (D3/D4), and putting it here keeps the driver a pure byte mover and keeps
//! the measured numbers next to the frames they were measured for.

        // instead not choose.
        //
        // WHAT MAKES THE DUPLICATES SAFE, precisely. Each hub deduplicates its OWN
        // queue on the payload hash (D6), which collapses a resend to the same hub.
        // It does NOT deduplicate across hubs: the hub has no notion of being
        // active or standby, so any hub that RECEIVES a migration will queue and
        // broadcast it.
        //
        // SENDING TO EVERY ADDRESS IS THE RULE, not a concession to the addresses
        // being dead. This comment used to say the opposite -- that send-to-all
        // was "safe only while the other addresses are DEAD", the list being the
        // current address plus the one just rotated away from (D10). That framing
        // predates Taylor Hornby's rule (2026-08-17, `PRODUCTION.md`): REPLICATE,
        // NEVER FAIL OVER. Multiple hubs are fine provided every hub receives
        // identical information, and the thing that must never exist is a shim
        // choosing its hub based on which looks healthy -- an attacker who can
        // make one hub look down to half the shims partitions the anonymity set
        // without touching a hub.
        //
        // So the behaviour here is right and must stay right: submit to every
        // address, unconditionally, never conditioned on liveness. Do not
        // "optimise" this into trying one address and falling back, and do not
        // build the hub-side passive mode the old rationale asked for -- that is
        // the anti-pattern, not the missing piece.
        //
        // Two hubs live at once both broadcast the same transaction. On-chain
        // that is harmless (the second is a known txid). The real costs are that
        // the migration appears in two batches at two moments, and that a second
