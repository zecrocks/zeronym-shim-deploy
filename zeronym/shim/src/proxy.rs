//! The transparent HTTP/2 (h2c) reverse proxy.
//!
//! Every request is forwarded to the backing indexer with its method, path,
//! headers and streaming body intact, and the response is streamed back with
//! its status, headers, body and TRAILERS intact. Trailers are the part that is
//! easy to lose and expensive to lose: gRPC carries `grpc-status` in the
//! trailers, so a proxy that drops them turns every successful call into
//! "server closed the stream without sending a status".
//!
//! Two rules keep that property, and they are the review checklist for this
//! file:
//!
//! 1. On the pass-through path, bodies are only ever re-wrapped, never read.
//!    `Response::map` rewraps the body value without polling it, and `map_err`
//!    and `boxed` are frame-preserving adapters, so DATA frames stay lazy
//!    (streaming survives) and the trailers frame survives with them.
//! 2. No `collect()` and no `Full::new()` anywhere outside
//!    [`crate::intercept`]. Either one silently converts a stream into a buffer
//!    AND discards the trailers.
//!
//! The single intercepted path is `SendTransaction`, handled by
//! [`crate::intercept`]. Both paths egress through the same [`forward`], so the
//! intercept path cannot drift away from the pass-through path.
//!
//! The third rule, and the one this file got wrong once already:
//!
//! 3. **The interception set must be a SUPERSET of every routing predicate any
//!    supported backend uses, never a subset.** A predicate narrower than the
//!    backend's fails OPEN: the backend acts on a request the classifier never
//!    saw. Concretely, the vendored tonic server Zaino is built from dispatches
//!    on `req.uri().path()` alone, with no HTTP-method guard
//!    (`zaino/packages/zaino-proto/src/proto/service.rs:1384`), so a `GET` to
//!    the `SendTransaction` path reaches its `send_transaction` handler. An
//!    earlier version of [`route_for`] also required `POST`, which made exactly
//!    that request bypass the classifier. See [`Route`].
//!
//! Transport is plaintext h2c with prior knowledge: no TLS, no HTTP/1.1, no
//! upgrade dance. `curl http://...` will look broken; `grpcurl -plaintext` and
//! tonic channels over `http://` both work, because both use prior knowledge.
