//! The shim-to-hub wire frames, version 1: `SubmitV1` out and `AckV1` back for
//! a diverted migration; `LookupV1` out and `LookupReplyV1` back for a
//! hub-served `GetTransaction` (the shim is stateless and routes every lookup
//! to the hub).
//!
//! This is the byte layout the Nym mixnet transport carries. It is written here
//! and, byte for byte, in `zero-indexer-hub`'s own `wire` module. The two crates
//! are separate workspaces on purpose (each lockfile is authoritative for its own
//! reproducible build), so the codec cannot be shared as a dependency; instead a
//! committed golden-vector file, identical in both crates' fixtures, fails a test
//! loudly the moment the two encoders drift.
//!
//! Two properties this layer exists to hold:
//!
//! * **Fixed size.** Every `SubmitV1` and every `LookupReplyV1` is exactly
//!   [`FRAME_BYTES`], every `AckV1` is exactly [`ACK_BYTES`], and every
//!   `LookupV1` is exactly [`LOOKUP_BYTES`], padded with zeros, so a record's
//!   length carries no information to any layer that can see it. In particular
//!   a lookup reply's size hides found-versus-not-found as well as the
//!   transaction's true length, which lives in the `tx_len` field, read only
//!   after the frame is decrypted.
//! * **No txid as a correlation handle.** Correlation between a request and its
//!   reply is by a random 16-byte nonce the shim mints, never a txid (the txid
//!   is a control input an adversary could write; the shim computes it itself
//!   from the bytes). The nonce is echoed in the reply and matched there. The
//!   one hash the wire does carry is `LookupV1`'s queried hash, which IS the
//!   query, not a handle: the reply echoes only the nonce.
//!
//! ```text
//! SubmitV1, exactly FRAME_BYTES:
//!   0    magic    4   b"ZNS1"
//!   4    nonce   16   request nonce, from OsRng
//!   20   tx_len   4   u32 big-endian
//!   24   tx       tx_len bytes
//!   ..   padding  zeros to FRAME_BYTES
//!
//! AckV1, exactly ACK_BYTES:
//!   0    magic    4   b"ZNA1"
//!   4    nonce   16   echoed request nonce
//!   20   disp     1   0 accepted, 1 refused
//!   21   refusal  1   0 none, else an AckRefusal code
//!   ..   padding  zeros to ACK_BYTES
//!
//! LookupV1, exactly LOOKUP_BYTES:
//!   0    magic     4   b"ZNL1"
//!   4    nonce    16   request nonce, from OsRng
//!   20   hash_len  1   length of the queried hash (normally 32)
//!   21   hash      hash_len bytes, wire order
//!   ..   padding   zeros to LOOKUP_BYTES
//!
//! LookupReplyV1, exactly FRAME_BYTES:
//!   0    magic     4   b"ZNR1"
//!   4    nonce    16   echoed request nonce
//!   20   disp      1   0 found, 1 not_found, 2 error
//!   21   height    8   u64 big-endian, 0 = mempool
//!   29   tx_len    4   u32 big-endian
//!   33   tx        tx_len bytes (found only)
//!   ..   padding   zeros to FRAME_BYTES
//! ```
//!
//! Decode is strict about the header and deliberately lax about the padding: a
//! wrong total length, a bad magic, a length field that overruns the frame, or
//! a reply whose disposition and payload fields disagree is a [`WireError`]
//! (the hub answers a bad request as `bad_frame`), but the bytes past the
//! declared region are never read, so nothing downstream can smuggle meaning
//! into the padding.
