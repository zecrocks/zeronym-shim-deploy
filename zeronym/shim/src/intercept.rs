//! The two intercepted methods: `SendTransaction` and `GetTransaction`.
//!
//! **`SendTransaction`** is buffered, the 5-byte gRPC length prefix stripped, the
//! `RawTransaction` decoded, and its `data` field handed to [`crate::classify`].
//! An Orchard-touching transaction is DIVERTED to the hub (never dialling the
//! operator), and the wallet gets a synthesized `SendResponse` carrying the hub's
//! txid, indistinguishable from a real indexer's reply. A pass-through, or a
//! migration when no hub is configured, is replayed to the operator's indexer
//! unchanged.
//!
//! **`GetTransaction`**, when a hub is configured, is answered by the hub (from
//! its queue, or its own indexer), never by the operator's. The shim keeps NO
//! record of what it diverted, so it cannot tell a migration's txid from any
//! other; routing every `GetTransaction` to the hub is what keeps a migration's
//! follow-up query off the operator's indexer. With no hub it passes through.
//!
//! Fail-safe for privacy binds at every layer above the classifier. A
//! `SendTransaction` the shim cannot read cleanly is treated as a migration and
//! diverted, never handed to the operator; these cases are decided here rather
//! than in the classifier:
//!
//! * a body shorter than the 5-byte prefix,
//! * the gRPC compression flag set, or a `grpc-encoding` other than `identity`,
//! * a declared message length that overruns or underruns the body,
//! * a `RawTransaction` that does not decode,
//! * a body over [`MAX_SEND_TX_BYTES`], or a client body stream that errored.
//!
//! And every failure on the divert or lookup path fails CLOSED: an unreachable
//! hub is a gRPC error to the wallet, never a fall-back to the operator, because
//! answering there is the exact leak this component exists to prevent.
